Components of SOAP Webservices
SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
- Communication Protocol
- Communication between applications
- Format for sending messages
- Platform independent
- Language dependent
- Allows you to get around a firewall
(banks use SOAP)

UDDI - Universal Description, Discovery & Integration
- A registry listing various web service server paths

WSDL - Web Service Description Language
- The contract
- Describes what the web service offers/accepts

WSDL Tages
Definitions - root
- Types - describe data type definitions
- Message - defines how data is communicated
- Porttypes - describe operations that can be performed and what messages 
are used for each
- Binding - protocol and data format for each porttype
- Service - describe the ports supported by the WS

Contract First SOAP
- Write the SWDC xml and generate java methods for the contract

Contract Last SOAP
Write the Java methods and generate a SWDL from them

SOAP Messages
Envelope - Root Tag
Head - Stores metadata about server
Body - stores actual data to be transmitted
Fault - inside the body tag, deals with about exceptions

SOAP
- Allows loosely coupled relations
- Little bit more coupled than REST
- Comes with WS-Security (SSL)
	Rest does not come with security
Contracts. Typically used for secure applications like banking, government contracts

REST
Representational State Transfer
- Web Service type
- Uses http methods to perform web service actions
- Stateless
- Everything is a resource
	- Each resource accessed through a unique URL
	- a mediatype (text, html, css, JSON, xml)

Jax_rs API
_restful API
Jersey
REST framework

Cross-Origin Resource sharing
CORS Servlet
Pasted in a server's web.xml

If you wanted your angular front-end to send REST to your server,
you would all requests from http://localhost:4200
