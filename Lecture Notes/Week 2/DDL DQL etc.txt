CONTSTRAINTS
PRIMARY KEY - ENFORCES A COLUMN TO BE NOT NULL & UNIQUE
	- SERVES AS THE MAIN WAY TO IDENTIFY DISTINCT RECORDS
FOREIGN KEY 
	- RELATION BETWEEN TWO TABLES
	- ALWAYS REFERENCES A DISTINCT COLUMN OF ANOTHER TABLE
UNIQUE
NULL / NOT NULL
CHECK -APPLIES AN EXTRACONDITIONAL TO DATA OF THE COLUMN

REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY
The enforcement of foreign key relationships. It prevents a user from inserting a record into
a table with a FK that points to a non existent element. It also prevents a user from deleting
a record that another table is referencing. On top of this, we cant drop a table, that another table references.
This is all to prevent orphan records, IE a record with no parent

WHERE CLAUSE
Use a where clause to apply any conditions to a CRUD operation

SELECT * FROM pets WHERE PET_ID > 2;
delete from pets where pet_id > 4;
delete from owners where owner_id = 3;

ALTER TABLE pets
RENAME TO pet_list;

rollback;
commit;

SQL Developer does not autocommit data. You must use commit to persist data
